# Paths to your train and validation image folders.
# Use relative paths from where you will run the training script.
# For example, if your dataset is in "helmet-detection/dataset/", the paths would be:
train: helmet_dataset_final/train/images
val: helmet_dataset_final/valid/images

test: helmet_dataset_final/test/images # Optional, for final testing later

# --- Class information ---
# Number of classes
nc: 3

# Class names in the EXACT order they correspond to your label IDs.
# In the safety_helmet-wearing-dataset:
# 0 is usually 'helmet'
# 1 is usually 'head' (we'll treat this as "no-helmet")
# 2 is usually 'person'
names: ['person', 'helmet', 'dog']
